## Establishing Data Provenance with vBase: A Secure and Lightweight Approach

1. vBase does not interfere with the existing data production process. Producers generate and store data using their established processes and systems.
2. When producers wish to establish data provenance, they call lightweight vBase commitment APIs. The APIs can receive data signatures, or they can be granted read access to the data to perform all the necessary operations automatically.
3. Signatures and timestamps that establish data integrity and provenance while preserving privacy are recorded by the vBase commitment service. The service is provided by a smart contract running on a blockchain, making the resulting commitments highly secure and tamper-proof.
4. vBase does not disrupt the existing data sharing and distribution processes. Producers can continue to share data with consumers using their familiar processes without any interference. Similarly, vBase respects consumers' data access and does not disturb their established procedures.
5. Likewise, vBase does not interfere with consumers' data access.
6. Consumers seeking to validate data and establish its provenance can easily achieve this through the lightweight vBase verification APIs.
7. These APIs perform data checks against the recorded commitments, thereby validating what data was known in the past and precisely when it became known.

By adopting vBase, organizations can ensure data provenance and maintain the reliability and security of their data without encountering any disruption in their current workflows. This non-intrusive approach guarantees the integrity of data while preserving user privacy, ultimately enhancing trust and accountability throughout the data lifecycle.
